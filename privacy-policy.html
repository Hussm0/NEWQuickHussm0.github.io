            <p>We share your information only when necessary for the purposes outlined above, and always with appropriate safeguards:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Independent Prescribing Pharmacists:</strong> Your personal and health information from your consultation form is shared with the GPhC-registered independent prescribing pharmacist assigned to your case to enable them to provide the consultation and prescribe safely.</li>
